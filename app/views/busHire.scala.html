      <p><strong>Our 16 Seater Fleet:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Our famous 'AS SEEN ON TV' pair of twin Arctic White Alero - 16 Seater Party Bus's:</strong>
          Our party bus fleet has featured on several Chanel 5 TV shows such as Celebrity Wedding Planner, Don't Tell The Bride, 
        and Hens Behaving Badly</p>
      
            <p><strong>Below - Our newly renovated black and chrome Mercedes with electric blue signage - 16 Seater Party Bus:</strong>
        All of our party bus's have been developed in-house to ensure they meet the same specifications onboard, you may even be lucky enough to
        ride onboard two of our 16 seaters if you are using us as transport to and from a destination. This all depends on the logistics and positioning
        of our fleet on your specific dates and times - similarly we cannot specify which of our 16 seater party bus's you will get 
        on the day of your booking at the point of reservation as this is likely to change near the day depending which towns and cities we are
        covering that weekend.</p>
